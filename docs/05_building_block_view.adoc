== Building Block View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System
image:DocumentationSection5.png["Whitebox Overall System"]

Motivation::

The building block view is meant to be as a quick overview of our application by making it's structure easily understandable throught abstraction.

Contained Building Blocks::

*Scope & Context:*
|===
| User         | A client using our application.
| Dede     | The application itself. 
| Pod     | The user's pod. It is external to our application. It is used by the application in order to preserve the privacy of our users. Will be provided by an external POD Provider.
|===

*Level 1:*

|===
| Frontend         | React application. Will contain the user interface as well as any client-side function the application may need. 
| Backend     | Node.js project. It will contain the REST API as well as any server-side function the application may need.
| Web Server     |  Instance of the  MySQL database.
|===
*Level 2:*

__These components are highly subject to change, given the early stage of the application development__

|===
| API Rest         | Node.js REST Api. Will be in charge of data read, write and delete operations. 
| GUI     | The interface system the user will interact with. 
|===

****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.
