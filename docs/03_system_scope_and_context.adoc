== System Scope and Context


=== Business Context

****

|===
|Entity |Inputs | Outputs

|User
|The user's input will be the interface provided by the webapp
|The outputs may be the POD generated by the user and also the information that will be received by the app

|POD
|The POD will store the users data in order to follow the SOLID project
|It will provide the information needed by the webapp

|Webapp
|The user will be able to make orders and also to access the information about their orders done
|The information that provides to the user logged

|Database
|The POD will have most of the information so we will not store it, but we will store other stuff like the products to buy
|Obviously the database will be linked to the web

=== Technical Context

****
////
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
////

The main goal is the decentralization of the application. This is done thanks to the PODs that will help us to ensure user's privacy.

What is a POD? In SOLID architecture we can define a POD as a Personal Online Data Store. The user can have there any information he/she wants and can be hosted anywhere.

The application will be written in Typescript with React, being Typescript a language similar to Javascript but with types and React a framework to facilitate the creation of user interfaces.
