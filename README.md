This project is a basic example of website using **React** with **Typescript** and serverless backend using Firebase.

## Quick start guide
<mark>In case you already have node.js and npm, make sure you update them before attempting to build the images</mark>

If you want to execute the project you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads). Make sure the three of them are installed in your system. Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/arquisoft/dede_0`. The fastest way to launch everything is running the script file in "scripting_automat" folder:
If your OS is Windows run:
```bash
 ./run_all_Windows.bat 
 ```
If you are in Linux:
```shell
run_all_Linux.sh
```

This will create a docker image as it does not exist in your system. The database is deployed as a [FireStore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore?hl=en) instance. You should be able to access everything from here:
 - [Webapp - http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

So literally you just have to run the provided script
